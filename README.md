# WiFiFox
WiFiFox is a menubar tool for bypassing captive portals in wireless networks. It also includes a tiny network scanner.

## How it Works
WiFiFox uses MAC spoofing to bypass the portal. It automates the following steps:

1) Discovers other connected clients and their MAC addresses through ping scan or passively.
2) Clones/spoofs these MAC addresses in random order.
3) Checks connection by attempting to reach a known public resource.

## Disclaimer
Only use this software on networks you own or have permission to use.
