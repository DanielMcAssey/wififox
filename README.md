# WiFiFox
WiFiFox is a tool for bypassing captive portals in wireless networks.

## How it Works
WiFiFox uses MAC spoofing to bypass the portal. It automates the following steps:

1) Discovers other connected clients and their MAC addresses.
2) Clones/spoofs these MAC addresses in random order.
3) Attempts to ping a known public IP.

## Disclaimer
Only use this software to test networks you own and have permission to test.
